These are the following types of boats:

1. **Sailboats**: These are propelled by sails and are typically used for leisure and racing. They can range from small, single-person dinghies to large yacht-style sailboats.

2. **Motorboats**: Also known as powerboats, these are propelled by an internal combustion engine. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including leisure, racing, or fishing.

3. **Yachts**: These are larger boats, typically 40 feet or longer, that can be used for both racing and cruising. Yachts can be sail or motor-powered and often contain luxury amenities.

4. **Fishing Boats**: These boats are designed specifically for fishing, with features like rod holders, livewells, and fishing decks. They can range from small jon boats to large charter boats.

5. **Personal Watercraft (PWC)**: These are small, jet-propelled boats that carry one to three people. They're used for recreation and racing.

6. **Pontoon Boats**: These boats are flat and rely on pontoons to float. They're typically used for leisurely cruising on calm waters.

7. **Cabin Cruisers**: These are medium-sized or large boats which provide accommodation for its crew and passengers inside the structure of the craft.

8. **Trawlers**: These are used for commercial fishing or cruising and are known for their large deck, superior engine, and displacement hull.

This is the typical propulsion types for a boat:

1. **Outboard Motor**: This is a self-contained unit that includes engine, gearbox, and propeller, designed to affix to the outside of the transom.

2. **Inboard Motor**: Located inside the boat, they deliver power to an external drive, such as a propeller or a jet drive.

3. **Stern Drive (or Inboard/Outboard)**: These are a system where the engine is located inboard, and the drive unit (containing the propeller) is outside the hull.

4. **Jet Drive**: This type propels the boat by ejecting a high-pressure water jet behind it. Commonly used in personal watercraft.

5. **Sail**: For sailboats, the wind provides the propulsion as it interacts with the sails.

6. **Paddle or Pedal**: For some smaller and personal boats like kayaks, canoes, or paddle boats.

Remember, the type of propulsion can have a significant impact on performance, fuel efficiency, maintenance requirements, and cost of the boat.
