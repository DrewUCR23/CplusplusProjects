These are the following types of cars:

1. **Sedan**: A traditional style with two rows of seats and a three-box configuration with separate compartments for the engine, passenger, and cargo.
   
2. **Coupe**: A car with a fixed-roof, usually with two doors, and a sportier appearance than a sedan.
   
3. **SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle)**: A larger vehicle designed for off-roading capabilities, but also used for city and highway driving. It typically has a high seating position and spacious interior.
   
4. **Hatchback**: A car with a rear door that opens upwards to provide access to a cargo area.
   
5. **Convertible**: A vehicle with a roof structure that can 'convert' and fold away, turning it into an open-air vehicle.
   
6. **Station Wagon**: A car with a body style that extends the roofline and incorporates a large rear cargo area accessed via a liftgate.
   
7. **Pick-up Truck**: A light-duty truck having an enclosed cab and an open cargo area with low sides and tailgate.
   
8. **Minivan**: A vehicle designed for personal use with a spacious interior and typically has three rows of seats with sliding side doors.
   
9. **Sports Car**: A car designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, or thrill of driving.
   
10. **Electric Vehicle (EV)**: A vehicle propelled by one or more electric motors, powered by a battery.

This is the typical engine types for a car:

1. **Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)**: This is the traditional type of car engine, which burns fuel (like petrol or diesel) in the engine's combustion chamber to produce power.

2. **Hybrid Engines**: These cars use both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. The battery for the electric motor recharges itself through regenerative braking and the internal combustion engine.

3. **Electric Motors**: Used in electric vehicles (EVs), these use electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device.

4. **Turbocharged Engines**: These are internal combustion engines that use a turbine to force more air, and thus more oxygen, into the combustion chamber, increasing power and efficiency.

5. **Supercharged Engines**: These are similar to turbocharged engines, but a supercharger is driven by the engine's crankshaft rather than exhaust gases. 

6. **Hydrogen Fuel Cells**: These convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, which then powers an electric motor. This type of engine is still quite rare but is growing in the automotive industry.

Remember, the type of engine can

 have a significant impact on performance, fuel efficiency, and cost of the vehicle.
